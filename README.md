### Hi, I'm Erik Darvich Matte! 👋

🎓 I studied **Computer and Management Engineering** and am now a **Full Stack MERN developer**. I have experience in multiple programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and C#.

💾 I have managed both Linux and Windows Server operating systems, and have administered virtual systems using VMware vSphere. As a technical pre-sales engineer, I've worked with hardware for Data Centers, focusing on HP and Dell servers.

🛡️ I specialized in protection and backup systems for enterprise information systems, including operating systems such as SUN, UNIX, Windows, Linux, and VMware vSphere. I have experience with databases like Oracle, SQL Server, and Informix, among others. I've also worked with applications such as MS Exchange, SharePoint, and file systems.

🌟 Currently, I'm working as an **IT Project Manager**, implementing in-house developed software for the banking industry and CRM-related projects.
